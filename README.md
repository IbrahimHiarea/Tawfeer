Expired Products Discount App

## Description

The Expired Products Discount App is a web or mobile application that allows users to view products that are nearing their expiration date. The system automatically reduces the price of the product by a fixed percentage, which is determined by the user upon entering the product. This allows users to purchase these products at lower prices than the market. When a product's expiration date is reached, the system completely hides it from the application, both from the product page and search results.

The selling process is conducted outside the application, meaning users can contact the seller directly through the contact information provided with the product details.

## Features

1. User registration within the application.
2. Login and logout functionality.
3. Users can add a new product with the following information:
   - Name

   - Category

   - Price
4. Users can browse all products within the application, with the product page displaying the image and name of each product.
5. Basic search functionality, allowing users to search for products by name, category, or expiration date.
6. Users can click on a specific product to view its details, including the information entered by the user.
7. Users can delete a product they have added.
8. Users can edit the information of a product they have added, except for the expiration date.
